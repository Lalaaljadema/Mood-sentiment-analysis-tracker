Tomorrow is the judgment day as they call it—the elocution competition that I have been preparing for all these days. I will be participating in it tomorrow. Just the thought of it has me shaken. My class teacher knows my insecurities about speaking to crowds. Maybe that’s why she forced me to take this up. I wonder what will happen tomorrow. I prepared a fairly good speech with my elder brother’s help. I am proud of him, though I will never admit it to him. He has a good command of the language. He is confident that I will do a good job. I hope I do. I’ve already practised it so many times that I can recite it in my sleep. I have to go to sleep now or else I will be late for school.
