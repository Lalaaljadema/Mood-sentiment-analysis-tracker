Today was the worst day of my life. It was as if I had woken up from the wrong side of the bed. To begin with, I was late for school since there was no water supply in the morning. Then I stumbled and fell while on my way to my first class. If all this was not enough, I was scolded by Miss Amera for not carrying my Math test book and the funny part is that the book was actually in my bag. Only I couldnâ€™t find it during the class. I cannot understand how so many incidents could occur in one single day. There must be something seriously wrong with me. The sad part is that I could not control what happened. All I can do is go to sleep now and just hope for a positive start tomorrow.
