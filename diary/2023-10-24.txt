Today during history class our teacher shared with us stories of a few freedom fighters. They intrigued me a lot as I could never imagine people giving up everything valuable to them for the nation and its people. These people are models of inspiration, especially in todayâ€™s day and age. The chief concern of every person these days is limited to his own luxuries and to that of his family. This has to change. As we see through history, progress can be achieved only when people give up their own interests in favour of the betterment of the larger society. The freedom fighters did their part in the struggle for our independence. It is our duty now to safeguard this freedom handed to us as a gift. We need to learn from them the value of selfless service and perseverance to do our part and give back to our country for the love and care we receive.
