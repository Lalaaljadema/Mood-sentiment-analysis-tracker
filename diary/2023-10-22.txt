 am very sorry for not writing to you last night. I was extremely tired after enjoying the entire day at Shangrila Resort. I could not even keep my eyes open. The place was so huge that by the end of the day we still felt like we did not see the entire place. It had one large pool for adults, two pools for children over 10 years, and a really shallow yet very cute pool for small children. There was a large waterfall as well. The entire place was surrounded by grass and trees. It felt as if we were in a real jungle. They also had speakers hidden in the trees giving sound effects of wild animals. The food too was fresh and filling. It gave us the energy to go on playing. We had a great time and wished we could stay there forever.
